## About this Directoy

This directory shows the usage of the following concepts in C programming:

1. What are nested loops and how to use them
2. What is a function and how do you use functions
3. What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
4. What is a prototype
5. Scope of variables
6. What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
7. What are header files and how to to use them with #include
